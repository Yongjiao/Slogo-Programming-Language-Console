<h3>**Introduction**</h3>
<p>The project is to create a basic and agile framework for a simplified Slogo game. The goal is to design the framework so that the program is adaptive to changes when additional turtle commands and GUI components are added in the future. We wish to make our code as reusable as possible, and to keep as much of the components closed as we could. By dividing the project by teams of front-end and back-end, the communication will be solely based on the API that both parties both agreed upon. Our API specifies the separation of front end and back end clearly by passing commands to parser in back-end from UI, and list of line information (coordinates) and orientation to be drawn in UI from back-end. Parsers will be divided into Mathparser and Commandparser, intermediate results will also be passed around for more complex commands. Those parameters remain open within either classes in UI or classes in backend, while everything else should remain relatively closed. There may be situations where we need to pass different parameters within “small” classes with specific functionality, and those will also be open. We will have classes that define the basic behaviors like forward, backward, loops and math operations, but also classes for syntax error checking or handling user-defined behaviors. This way, the structures remain clear to allow for additional flexibility and clarity.</p>
<h3>**Overview**</h3>
<p>The main class file for slogo_team16 is called <a class="el" href="../../d0/da5/_main_8java.html">Main.java</a>. This class will initialize the GUI, View, Turtle, TurtleHandler, Pen, and CommandFactory classes. The CommandFactory is given access to the TurtleHandler, the TurtleHandler is given access to the View and Turtle, the View is given access to the Pen. The GUI displays a text field, buttons, drop-down menus, as well as previous commands and current variables entered. Once the user enters a command into the text field, the GUI class calls the ErrorCheck class to verify - using regular expressions - that the input is a valid form of either 1) command parameter(s), 2) command command parameter(s), or 3) command MathOperation parameter(s). If the command or list of commands are valid, the command String is then added to a savedCommands ArrayList&lt;String&gt; and is displayed on the side panel of previous commands. The command is then executed. Variables added by the user are also put into a savedVars ArrayList&lt;Map&gt; of String names and integer values, and are displayed on another side panel of variables. To execute commands, each command is identified through a HashMap of String keys and Object values, where each object is an instance of one of the CommandFactory classes. For example, [“fd,” “FD,”, “forward”] are mapped to [new Forward()]. Then, the next input - which may be an integer, for instance - is read, and the Forward command is then executed with the integer as a parameter. The turtle image moves and a line is drawn through the View class, as will be explained later.</p>
<p>Commands are grouped into categories based on behavior and number of parameters as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Movement commands: ``` public class Move(int steps) { changeLocation(int s) { TurtleHandler.updateLocation(s); } } ``` <pre class="fragment">Subclasses:
    Forward(int s)
    Backward(int s)
    GoToLocation(int x, int y)
    GoHome()
</pre></li>
<li>Rotation commands: ``` public class Rotate(int degrees) { changeOrientation(int a) { TurtleHandler.updateDir(a); } } ``` <pre class="fragment">Subclasses:
    Right(int a)
    Left(int a)
    GoTowardsLoc(int x, int y)
    SetHeading(int a)
</pre></li>
<li>Arithmetic computation commands: ``` public class Arithmetic(int a, int b) { add(a, b) {. . . }; mult(a, b) {. . . }; div(a, b) {. . . }; } ``` <pre class="fragment">Sublcasses:
    Add(int a, int b)
    Subtract(int a, int b)
    Multiply(int a, int b)
    Divide(int a, int b)
    Remainder(int a, int b)
</pre></li>
<li>Single number calculation commands: ``` public class Calculate(int a) { . . . }; ``` <pre class="fragment">Subclasses:
    Random (int a)
    Minus (int a)
    Tan (int a)
    Sin (int a)
    Cos (int a)
    ATan (int a)
    Log (int a)
    Pow (int a)
    PI()
</pre></li>
<li>Comparison commands: ``` public class Compare(int a, int b) { isLess(a, b) {. . . }; isEqual(a, b) {. . . }; } ``` <pre class="fragment">Subclasses:
    Less(int a, int b)
    Greater(int a, int b)
    Equal(int a, int b)
    NotEqual(int a, int b)
</pre></li>
<li>Conditional commands: ``` public class IfElse(int expr, ArrayList&lt;String&gt; commIf, ArrayList&lt;String&gt; commElse) { execute() { if (expr != 0) { // execute each commIf } else { // execute each commElse } } } ``` <pre class="fragment">Subclasses: 
    IfCond(int e, ArrayList&lt;String&gt; ifs)
    IfElseCond(int e, ArrayList&lt;String&gt; ifs,
        ArrayList&lt;String&gt; elses)
</pre></li>
<li>Looping commands: ``` public class Loop(int start, int end, ArrayList&lt;String&gt; commands) { execute() { for (int i = start; i &lt; end; i++) { // execute each command in commands } } } ``` <pre class="fragment">Subclasses:
    Repeat(int numTimes, ArrayList&lt;String&gt; commands)
    DoTimes(int numTimes, ArrayList&lt;String&gt; commands)
    For(int start, int end, ArrayList&lt;String&gt; commands)
</pre></li>
<li>Setting variables commands: ``` public class SetVariable(String name, int value) {. . .} ``` <pre class="fragment">Subclasses:
    Make(String variableName, int val)
    Set(String variableName, int val)
</pre></li>
</ul>
<p>Within each of the CommandFactory subclasses, the executing methods update the turtle by calling the appropriate TurtleHandler method. For example, the Move methods would call TurtleHandler.updateLocation(…) while the Rotate methods would call TurtleHandler.updateOrientation(…). In turn, the TurtleHandler class updates the xLocation, yLocation, and/or orientation of the Turtle, and may also update the turtle’s visibility based on the input command. The TurtleHandler class also updates the front end as well, by calling the View class’s methods of changeTurtleImage(Point2D newLocation) or clearScreen() based on the input command. Depending on the Pen class’s status accessed by the View, it decides whether or not to draw a line (drawLine(Point2D start, Point2D end) which uses the stroke() method from JavaFX’s GraphicsContext). The Pen’s status is determined through user input.</p>
<p>Other features are planned as follows:</p><ul>
<li>Pen Color: provides user with a color picker; selected color is sent to View class to change the line color using the appropriate method from GraphicsContext</li>
<li>BackgroundColor: provides user with a color picker; selected color is sent to the View class to change the Canvas color</li>
<li>Turtle Image: is sent to View class to changeTurtleImg(ImageView newImg)</li>
<li>Language: provides user with a list of languages; GUI loads appropriate ResourceBundler</li>
<li>Open file: access user’s local computer and allows user to upload file of commands; GUI class parses commands line by line and instantiates appropriate commands</li>
<li>Save as file: allows user to save recent commands as file to access later</li>
</ul>

<h3>**User Interface**</h3>
<p>The program’s UI will be laid out as shown below. There will be drop down menu for pen/background color selection, language, turtle image, helper page on the top. A file chooser to take in files with commands to run or load previously saved points. Ideally, there will also be an option for saving the current progress of the game to a file, so that the user will be able to continue with where he or she left off. To the far right, there will be three sections for previous commands, variables and current user-defined commands. To the lower bottom, a Textfield for commands will take in correctly formatted commands users want to execute.</p>
<p>All these items will be designed through JavaFX SceneBuilder. Through SceneBuilder, we will obtain both the Controller and a .css file, as discussed in class.</p>
<p>The language selection will utilize .properties files as discussed in class. The three sections for previous commands, variables and current user-defined commands will all be clickable to potentially display what the code does or just simply executes the code.</p>
<p>The Turtle and the drawn lines will be shown in a separate View class, which is simply mounted onto the GUI. The GUI does not actually manage this View class, but is positioned inside the GUI.</p>
<p>The TextField box is where all the magic happens. When the "Enter" button is clicked or "Enter" is pressed on the keyboard, the following will happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>First check the inputted commands for errors through an error checking class.</li>
<li>If there are no errors, we will:<ul>
<li>Add the command to the previous commands display list</li>
<li>Parse the input and call our Commands class to execute the command.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>**Design Details**</h3>
<p>We will go over all the commands in the Design Details thoroughly.</p>
<p>Movement Commands: The movement commands have a super class called Move. The subclasses Forward, Backward, GoToLocation, and GoHome extend the Move class because they have similar properties in that they physically move from one location the turtle from one location to another. Each subclass will call the TurtleHandler to both update location of the Turtle itself, and draw the turtle on the canvas.</p>
<p>Rotation commands: The rotation commands have a super class called Rotate. The subclasses Right, Left, GoTowardsLoc, and SetHeading all extend the Rotation class because they all have similar properties that physically rotates the turtle and thus its orientation. Each subclass again called TurtleHandler to both update the orientation of the Turtle and update the turtle image orientation in the View class.</p>
<p>Arithmetic computation commands: The arithmetic computation commands have a super class called Arithmetic. The class has subclasses add, subtract, multiply, divide, and remainder because they all do similar math operational things. Add will call super.add. Subtract will also call super.add, but with one of its parameters being negative. Multiply will call super.mult. Divide will call super.mult but taking the inverse of b. Remainder will simply call div(a, b). This class has no dependencies from other classes because it does not need to manipulate other classes.</p>
<p>Single number calculation commands"
This is essentially a "miscellaneous" math commands section because each of the subclasses Random, Minus, Tan, Sin, Cos, ATan, Log, Pow, and Pi could be represented uniquely without having dependencies on each other. Each command is unique. This class again has no dependencies because it does not need to manipulate other classes.</p>
<p>For the comparison commands, the Compare class contains two methods - isLess and isEqual - both of which take in two integer parameters. The former method returns true if the first parameter is less than the second, and the latter method returns true if both parameter integers are equal. The subclass Less(a, b) calls the super class’s isLess method as isLess(a,b), while the subclass Greater(a, b) calls the super class’s isLess method as isLess(b,a) to compare the opposite way. Likewise, the subclass Equal(a, b) calls the super class’s isEqual method as isEqual(a,b), while the subclass NotEqual(a, b) calls the super class’s isEqual method but returns the opposite of the returned boolean.</p>
<p>For conditional commands, the IfElse class takes in an integer for the condition, and two lists of commands - one that executes within the if statement, and the other that executes in the else statement. As a result, the IfElseCond subclass calls the execute method accordingly. For the IfCond subclass - initialized if the user only inputs an if condition and no else condition - the commands for the else statement are simply set to null.</p>
<p>For looping commands, the Loop class contains parameters of start and ending integers, as well as a list of commands. If the user inputs the command repeat [numTimes][commands], the Repeat class initializes the start integer to 0, the ending integer to numTimes, and calls the Loop’s execute method accordingly to execute each command in the commands list. If the user inputs the command doTimes [numTimes][commands], the DoTimes class initializes the start integer to 0 and also calls the Loop’s execute method accordingly. If the user inputs the command for [begin][finish][commands], the For class initializes the start integer to begin, the ending integer to finish, and calls the Loop’s execute method to execute each command in the for loop.</p>
<p>For setting variables, the SetVariable command class takes in a String name of the variable as well as an integer value of the variable. If the user inputs either the command make[name][value] or set[name][value] the SetVariable class is instantiated and passed in the appropriate parameters.</p>

<p>```</p>
<h3>**Design Considerations**</h3>
<p>We had many design considerations for this project.</p>
<p>1) Providing general classes for commands such as movements, rotations, etc. vs creating a class for each individual command. For example, should we create a move class that contains goForward, goBackward, goRight, goLeft, and somehow call these? Or should we create a Forward class, a Backward class, and so on.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pros of creating individual classes:<ul>
<li>Very easy to assign each class to parsed data</li>
<li>Very low-level polymorphism, which means absolute elimination of type conditionals</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cons of creating individual classses:<ul>
<li>Potential for duplicated code because some of these classes do very similar things</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pros of creating general classes:<ul>
<li>Eliminates duplicated code</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cons of creating general classes:<ul>
<li>Harder to interpret parsed data without using conditionals</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We decided to go with creating individual classes for each command. We determined that we were able to attempt to minimize duplicated code by utilizing another level of polymorphism. For example, we will have an abstract Move class with a Forward method. Forward and Backward sub-classes that extend Move will both call the Forward method in the super class. This doesn't completely solve the issue of duplicated code, but it is a step forward.</p>
<p>2) Maps vs. Reflection Another design consideration we had for parsing was utilizing maps vs reflection.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pros of using maps<ul>
<li>Much easier to maintain and keep track of</li>
<li>It is a familiar data structure that we could easily implement</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cons of using maps<ul>
<li>The values of the map are not dynamic, so we can't put method calls directly into map</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pros of using reflection<ul>
<li>Self-evaluating code is always good to get rid of type conditionals</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cons of using reflection<ul>
<li>Has limitations in that our parsed strings much match the class name</li>
<li>We haven't formally learned about this in class yet</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We decided to use maps because it seems to be easier to implement for our setup.</p>
<p>3) View class inside GUI class or inside Main method Another design consideration we had was whether we wanted to initialize the View class inside the GUI class or inside the Main method. We considered putting the view class inside the GUI class because we felt that the canvas for which the turtle moves should be considered part of the GUI. However, we determined that the View class is more for visualization and viewing and less about user interaction. It would also be much easier to communicate to the View class through our main class than through our GUI. Therefore, we decided to initialize our View class inside the main class.</p>
